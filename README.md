# Hangman


## Introduction

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Usage / Installation 

Clone the repository by running the following command inside a terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/IngaPosiunaite/hangman864.git 
```

Then within the folder, run 

```
main.py
```

## What I've Learned

1. Built an implementation of the Hangman game in Python
2. Handled errors in user input and built the conditional logic to run the game
3. Utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation and abstraction
